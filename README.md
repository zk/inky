# inky.cc

A ClojureScript sketchbook.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zkim/nsfw.png)](https://travis-ci.org/zk/inky)

![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3N443a2i1m0j21053A3N/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-23%20at%203.45.41%20PM.png)


## Working on Sketches Locally

Inky has a dev mode to work on sketches locally. Why? Sub-second (2-3s
now, sub-second to return shortly) recompiles and source maps.

Just add the lein-inky plugin to your `~/.lein/profiles.clj` like so:

```bash
{:user {:plugins [[lein-inky "0.1.4"]]}}
```

After that:

1. Create a gist with a cljs file. For this example we'll call it `first.cljs`.
2. Clone that gist locally: `git clone git@gist.github.com/<gist-id>.git`
3. `cd <gist-id>`
4. `lein inky`. Once the server is running visit
   [http://localhost:4659](http://localhost:4659).


One gotcha, for source maps to correctly resolve your file, you must
name it after the last part of the ns. For example, if the ns if your
sketch is `foo.bar.baz`, name the file `baz.cljs` (in the root
directory of the gist).

## Prereqs

* https://github.com/ddollar/foreman
* http://www.mongodb.org/ (brew / apt / yum ok)


## Config

Env vars:

* `PORT` -- web port to bind to
* `AWS_ACCESS_ID` -- s3 creds
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* `AWS_S3_BUCKET` -- s3 bucket to store compiled code
* `GA_TRACKING_ID` -- Google Analytics
* `GA_TRACKING_HOST` -- ex. 'inky.cc'
* `MONGO_URL` -- DB connection url, mongodb:// format
* `GH_CLIENT_ID` -- GH app creds
* `GH_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `NUM_WORKERS` -- Number of compile workers to spawn, defaults to 2


## Dev

Copy bin/dev.sample to bin/dev, fill in appropriate env vars. Note that the env vars are only necessary if you're working on inky. If you're working on a sketch locally, only `$PORT` is required (provided by foreman).

**Warning:** There's a nasty bug where foreman won't correctly kill java processes it starts **when foreman exits due to a child process exiting** (this behavior doesn't manifest when you SIGINT foreman). You may need to manually kill previous processes manually.


## Testing

Run `bin/test`


## Deploy

Deploys to Heroku. Run `bin/ship`

* Don't forget to bump inky's version number any time deps change
  (including dep version changes).


## TODO

* Report compilation progress on compile page
* Handle s3 connection error / timeout (errors into compiling state
  right now).
* Chart compile wait times
* Compile times are looooooong, ~45-120 seconds on heroku, figure
  something out here.
* Implement better way than newing `Thread`s for spawning workers
* Fix mobile experience


## Internals

### Job States

Inky runs several worker threads internally to compile gists, which
pull from a job queue backed by MongoDB (`:compile-jobs`). Jobs
transition through several states as they are compiled, and as errors
pop up. All flags are unix timestamps unless otherwise specified.

* Enqueued -- `:created` is set.
* Compiling -- `:created` and `:started` are set.
* Compile completed successfully -- `:created`, `:started`, and
  `:succeeded` are set.
* Compile errored -- `:created`, `:started`, and `:failed` are set
  (see `:error-cause` for message).

This is a first cut on representing the different job states.
